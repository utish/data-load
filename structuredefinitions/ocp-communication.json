  "description": "This OCP (Omnibus Care Plan) Communication profile describes an occurrence of information being transmitted. A communication is a conveyance of information from one entity, a sender, to another entity, a receiver and the information is delivered only once. The sender and receivers may be patients, practitioners, related persons, organizations, or devices. It identifies which core elements, extensions, and value sets SHALL be present in the resource when using this profile.\r\nCommunication does not deal with the duration of a call, it represents the fact that information was transferred at a particular point in time.",
